# Game title
"Alien Invasion"

# Project Title
My first ever game I coded.

# Author
Sten-Eric Käämer

I coded the game mainly myself. Got a bit of help from the teacher.

# Description
The aim of the game is to kill all the invading Aliens with the space ship. The ship is able to shoot as many bullets as you like. You have in total 3 lives. If you do not die, you can play the game forever.

Dependencies
If using pycharm you must import pygame.
You may use any OS that supports python codes.

# Installing
At the moment I believe the best way to play this game is to download it and then use a program called PyCharm. Once you download both the program and the game, then you should be able to unzip and insert the files of the game into the program. 

Here is a link to PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
